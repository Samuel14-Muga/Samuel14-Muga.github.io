    <p class="w3-large">It is said that Engineers bring thought to reality, and this could not have motivated me any more to tread this path. As a mechatronic engineer, I knew my opportunities would be widespread across the fields of electrical, mechanical, electro-mechanical, software and control engineering. From a young age, I took a keen interest in science. Going through primary school, mathematics was my favourite. Fast forward to secondary school, I took interest in Chemistry and Physics. From then on, I knew a future in engineering was the way to go, and Mechatronic engineering would satisfy all the wants I had.</p>
    <p class="w3-large">My course has enabled me to gain theoretical knowledge and physical skills in different areas. Through practicals and workshop, I have been able to gain hands-on experience on different machines such as the lathe machine and CNC milling machine, and usage of tools such as files, hacksaws and drills. I was also introduced to different fields such as the automotive, plumbing and welding. At Gearbox, I had experience with the operations of microcontrollers and microprocessors, which is an important aspect in the field of control engineering.</p>
    <p class="w3-large">I look forward to making the world a better place through engineering.</p>
